## Hi 👋, My name is Dominik

I'm a seasoned network engineer and i think that networks power the world, 
but code makes them smarter, faster and more resilient.

Actually diving deep into the world of coding and DevOps. 
Daily I weave automation into network infrastructure with tools like: 
Python, Ansible, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.

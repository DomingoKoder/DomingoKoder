 Hi 👋  
 My name is Dominik  
  
  I'm a Network Engineer and I think that networks power the  world 🌍  
  But code makes them smarter, faster and more resilient.  

🌍 I'm based in Lublin, Poland  
🌱 Actually diving deep into the world of DevOps, coding and systems.  
📝 Preparing for RedHat Linux and Kubernetes certification.
